# Word Guess / Hangman Game

### Description

In this game, I created computer Word Guess game. The apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code.

I used the following folder structure:

```
├── assets
|  ├── css
|  |  └── style.css
|  ├── images
|  └── javascript
|     └── game.js
└── index.html
```

## How the game works:

The theme for my game is sports legends!

You use the keyboard to select the letters you would like to guess.  

The games keeps track of wins and losses: (# of times user guessed the word correctly or losses when you run out of guesses).

I keep track of the number of guesses rRemaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

The game also keeps track of the letters Already Guessed.

After you win/lose the game will automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
